# TODO

## Initial Demo
- Show the array and how it's changing (use HTML list to track the number of calls?)
- Show the variables from the loop in a table
- Fill the table as the code progresses

## UI
- Some basic styling
- Code syntax highlighting
- Make it nice on mobile

## Follow-on work
- Can we step forward and back through the code?
- Can we override console.log so we don't need special logging functions?
- Is it possible to show the diagram(s) and tables without changing the code?
- Let the user change in the input and output
