# Demo. Kiss
- Page which renders the code <pre>
- Show the variables from the loop in a table
- Fill the table as the code progresses
- Show the array and how it's changing

## Follow-on work
- Can we step forward and back through the code?
- Is it possible to show the diagram(s) and tables without changing the code?
