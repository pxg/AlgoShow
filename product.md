The ideal is the user can write any javascript they want (without libraries) AgoShow is smart enough to understand the data structures and render usesful diagrams.

AlgoShow is also smart enough to understand the flow of the program and show it progressing in steps, either auto-played or manually controlled.

Need to decided is it a tool to support writing solutions to challenges like Hackerrank, or is it a learning tool. If it's the later then we will want to lean towards well contructed tutorials. If it's for solving challenges then need to figure out how to build on the Hackerrant/LeetCode communities. It could be something a mix like the editorials and discussion on Leetcode challenges to explain the approaches. With some solutions created by me but with the ability for users to submit their own.
